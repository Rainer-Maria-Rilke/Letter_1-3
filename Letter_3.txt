Viareggio, near Pisa (Italy)
April 23, 1903
You gave me much pleasure, dear Sir, with your Easter letter; for it brought
much good news of you, and the way you spoke about Jacobsen’s great and
beloved art showed me that I was not wrong to guide your life and its many
question to this abundance.
Now Niels Lyhne will open to you, a book of splendors and depths; the
more often one reads it, the more everything seems to be contained within it,
from life’s most imperceptible fragrances to the full, enormous taste of its heaviest
fruits. In it there is nothing that does not seem to have been understood, held
lived, and known in memory’s wavering echo; no experience has been too
unimportant, and the smallest event unfolds like a fate, and fate itself is like a
wonderful, wide fabric in which every thread is guided by an infinitely tender
hand and laid alongside another thread and is held and supported by a hundred
others. You will experience the great happiness of reading this book for the first
time, and will move through its numberless surprises as if you were in a new
dream. But I can tell you that even later on one moves through these books,
again and again, with the same astonishment and that they lose none of their
wonderful power and relinquish none of the overwhelming enchantment that
they had the first time one read them.
One just comes to enjoy them more and more, becomes more and more
grateful, and somehow better and simpler in one’s vision, deeper in one’s faith in
life, happier and greater in the way one lives. —
And later on, you will have to read the wonderful book of the fate and
yearning of Marie Grubbe, and Jacobsen’s letters and journals and fragments, and
finally his verses which (even if they are just moderately well translated) live in
infinite sound. (For this reason I would advise you to buy, when you can, the
lovely Complete Edition of Jacobsen’s works, which contains all of these. It is in
there volumes, well translated, published by Eugen Diederichs in Leipzig, and
costs, I think, only five or six marks per volume.)
In your opinion of “Roses should have been here . . . “ (that work of such
incomparable delicacy and form) you are of course quite, quite incontestably
right, as against the man who wrote the introduction. But let me make this
request right away: Read as little as possible of literary criticism — such things
are either partisan opinions, which have become petrified and meaningless,
hardened and empty of life, or else they are just clever word-games, in which one
view wins today, and tomorrow the opposite view. Works of art are of an infinite
solitude, and no means of approach is so useless as criticism. Only love can touch
and hold them and be fair to them. — Always trust yourself and your own
feeling, as opposed to argumentations, discussions, or introductions of that sort;
if it turns out that you are wrong, then the natural growth of your inner life will
eventually guide you to other insights. Allow your judgments their own silent,
undisturbed development, which, like all progress, must come from deep within
and cannot be forced or hastened. Everything is gestation and then birthing. To
let each impression and each embryo of a feeling come to completion, entirely in
itself, in the dark, in the unsayable, the unconscious, beyond the reach of one’s
own understanding, and with deep humility and patience to wait for the hour
when a new clarity is born: this alone is what it means to live as an artist: in
understanding as in creating.
In this there is no measuring with time, a year doesn’t matter, and ten years
are nothing. Being an artist means: not numbering and counting, but ripening
like a tree, which doesn’t force its sap, and stands confidently in the storms of
spring, not afraid that afterward summer may not come. It does come. But it
comes only to those who are patient, who are there as if eternity lay before them,
so unconcernedly silent and vast. I learn it every day of my life, learn it with pain
I am grateful for: patience is everything!
Richard Dehmel: My experience with his books (and also, incidentally, with
the man, whom I know slightly) is that whenever I have discovered one of his
beautiful pages, I am always afraid that the next one will destroy the whole effect
and change what is admirable into something unworthy. You have characterized
him quite well with the phrase: “living and writing in heat.” — And in fact the
artist’s experience lies so unbelievably close to the sexual, to its pain and its
pleasure, that the two phenomena are really just different forms of one and the
same longing and bliss. And if instead of “heat” one could say “sex” — sex in the
great, pure sense of the word, free of any sin attached to it by the Church — then
his art would be very great and infinitely important. His poetic power is great
and as strong as a primal instinct; it has its own relentless rhythms in itself
explodes from him like a volcano.
But this power does not always seem completely straightforward and
without pose. (But that is one of the most difficult tests for the creator: he must
always remain unconscious, unaware of his best virtues, if he doesn’t want to rob
them of their candor and innocence!) And then, when, thundering through his
being, it arrives at the sexual, it finds someone who is not quite so pure as it
needs him to be. Instead of a completely ripe and pure world of sexuality, it finds
a world that is not human enough, that is only male, is heat, thunder, and
restlessness, and burdened with the old prejudice and arrogance with which the
male has always disfigured and burdened love. Because he loves only as a male,
and not as a human being, there is something narrow in his sexual feeling,
something that seems wild, malicious, time-bound, uneternal, which diminishes
his art and makes it ambiguous and doubtful. It is not immaculate, it is marked
by time and by passion, and little of it will endure. (But most art is like that!)
Even so, one can deeply enjoy what is great in it, only one must not get lost in it
and become a hanger-on of Dehmel’s world, which is so infinitely afraid, filled
with adultery and confusion, and is far from the real fates, which make one suffer
more than these time-bound afflictions do, but also give one more opportunity
for greatness and more courage for eternity.
Finally, as to my own books, I wish I could send you any of them that might
give you pleasure. But I am very poor, and my books, as soon as they are published,
no longer belong to me. I can’t even afford them myself — and, as I
would so often like to, give them to those who would be kind to them.
So I am writing for you, on another slip of paper, the titles (and publishers)
of my most recent books (the newest ones — all together I have published
perhaps 12 or 13), and must leave it to you, dear Sir, to order one or two of them
when you can.
I am glad that my books will be in your good hands.
With best wishes,
Yours,
Rainer Maria Rilke
